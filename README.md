# Software CVE Match
This is an inefficient implementation of matching a Software Dataset (that contains columns of "Name" and its "Version") with a CVE Dataset ("Name" and its affected "Versions") for research purposes.


## Methodology
- Pruning their Name
- Cheking their Similarity Rate (Using RapidFuzz)



## Getting updated CVE dataset and change it to the appropriate structure
Since 2005 til now, CVE-Search Project collects the datasets of vulnerabilities (CVE). You can easily access to them [here](https://www.cve-search.org/dataset/). For feeding this dataset to our script, it needs some manipulation and extractions. Simply run `get-cves.py` to download and do the rest for you.
