# Software CVE Match
This is an inefficient implementation of matching a Software Dataset (that contains columns of "Name" and its "Version") with a CVE Dataset ("Name" and its affected "Versions") for research purposes.

# Methodology
- Pruning their Name
- Cheking their Similarity Rate (Using RapidFuzz)
